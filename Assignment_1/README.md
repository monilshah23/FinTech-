# 2. Business Activities

Being in the financial industry for more than two decades, the founders were able to identify that there are may investors who are paying hefty fees for their investments for a nominal returns. To solve the issue of overcharged and underserved, founders came up with Justwealth Financial Inc. Justwealth is a robo-advisory firm providing pre-built portfolios of Exchange Traded Funds (ETF) each constructed with unique needs of investors.

With the wide range of portfolios to select from, Justwealth is a unique robo-advisor platform targeting Generation X, the biggest segment who holds around 40% of their revenues and clientele.

As Kirkland said: 
> “We were targeting people who were in their late 30s, early 40s, and maybe had begun to build some kind of nest egg. So, when we looked at developing our portfolio lineup, we took that into consideration.”

The company’s major advantage which keeps them separate from the crowd is that they provide over 70 various pre-defined portfolios which are made from more than 40 ETFs from 9 different providers like including [Vanguard, iShares and Schwab](https://www.wealthprofessional.ca/news/industry-news/five-best-robo-advisors-in-canada/356959) . These portfolios are created for different types of risk tolerance and to have a good diversification for the investors with geographic options like Canada, the US and global markets. They mainly focus on capital appreciation (growth focused), steady income(income focused) or wealth retention (conservative focused) portfolios. 

On top of the various portfolio options, investors also have benefit of dedicated Personal Portfolio Manager and support team. Once the portfolio is selected and funds are invested the manager will review and rebalance it periodically so that the investments are well aligned to the clients objectives. https://www.finder.com/ca/justwealth-robo-advisor

Justwealth provides services for all types of accounts like:

-  Spousal RRSP

Along with that the company provides target dated portfolios for the specific future needs of the clients with a predefined maturity year. For example; the company  has target dated portfolios for Registered Educational Savings Plan (RESP). The target-dated portfolios are customized in regards to the future maturity year where it automatically changes its allocation starting from growth focused to eventually conservative when the year of maturity arrives i.e. the beneficiary turns 18 and admits into higher education.

Founder explains it better:
> “We’re able to target to the exact year that a beneficiary is going to be enrolling in [post- secondary] school. So, someone in that age range – late 30s, early 40s, mid-40s – would be somebody who would be most likely utilizing a service like this [for their children].”

**Justwealth** tends to focus more on the ‘Fin’ part of the Fintech. As they also have a unique features of tax harvesting. The company works closely with their non-registered account holders. They not only provide strategic tax-efficient portfolios but also manages the tax implications by working with the investors on the annual tax loss harvesting strategies. Moreover, the investments fees on their taxable portfolios are tax deductible.

The company provides superior investment services and customized solutions for the clients that makes it a unique robo-advisory service with a human touch which keeps them out of the box.

Their *FREE PORTFOLIO REVIEW* service is something really impressive. They provide free portfolio review from their managers who analyze the investments in regards to expenses, asset allocations, performance, etc and for that one needs not to be their current client.

Comparing Justwealth’s pricing with competitors in the modern wealth management industry, the average fees on a mutual fund is 2% and in comparison to that Justwealth offers a low fee 0.50% for the accounts worth of $5000 - $500,000 and 0.40% on accounts worth more than $500,000. Along with that up to 0.25% management fees charged by the funds. Justwealth have a standard minimum fees of $10/month on the accounts below $25000. The best part of Justwealth’s pricing is they do not charge minimum on RESP accounts.

#### The impact of fees on your investment portfolio
[ To see just how important fees can be, consider an investor with $100,000. A Justwealth client would pay a low, annual management fee of 0.50%, plus (on average) an additional 0.20% in ETF management fees. A typical mutual fund charges 2.20%. What would you do with the extra money? ](https://www.justwealth.com/pricing/)

Generally speaking, through AI and data, robo-advisors look for more in-depth information for the investors and provide appropriate investment options.

# 3. Landscape & 4. Results

Before we dig into *Robo-Advisory Landscape*, 

I wanted to quote a tweet from **Toronto Finance International**

>Canadian [#FinTech](https://twitter.com/hashtag/FinTech?src=hashtag_click) attracted $4.8 billion in the first half of 2021 and has surpassed the previous annual high reached in 2017. FinTech investment is expected to continue strongly, especially in the [#AI](https://twitter.com/hashtag/AI?src=hashtag_click)-driven solutions, [#payments](https://twitter.com/hashtag/payments?src=hashtag_click), and [#crypto](https://twitter.com/hashtag/crypto?src=hashtag_click) spaces.
Justwealth operates as the low-cost version of modern fintech robs-advisory firm, where they focus more on the “Fin” part. With the digital service the company provides they also have a human touch to it.

In regards to *Robo-advisory*, key market trends that helped to drive the growth in this industry are rapid digitalization in the financial services sector, investors preference to robo-advisor from the traditional brick & mortar and the major role for the massive growth in the industry is because of the low-cost services that the current platforms provides.

There are many key players in the roba-advisory sector so far but the top Canadian robo-advisor are

	Wealthsimple
	
	Questwealth Portfolios  
	
	CI Direct Investing
	
	Justwealth
	
	Nest Wealth

Providing cost-effective services along with human touch, Justwealth is one of the growing key players in the Canadian industry with competing with other digital financial planners and wealth managers.

Companies in this domain are tend to measured by their assets under management (AUM) and the clients they acquire. However, this information for Justwealth is not available at the moment.

# Recommendation 

If I were to advise Justwealth I would recommend them to work a bit more on the technology side of the business. The company tends to have a great back end service but the user interface is something they need to work on, to which investors can have a smoooth investment experience.  
I would also recommend them to create a mobile application to be more accessible to their clients.

In regards to the business aspects they have a minimum balance requirements for $5000 which as per their target market is relevant but in order to acquire more clients the company should think to lower it to a nominal market amount (which is $1000) or cut down to $0 requirement.

By 2018 Justwealth also directed its focus towards institutional clients partnering up with Advisors, Group RRSPs, Corporate Accounts and with Not-for-profit Organizations. https://www.justwealth.com/jwi/ 
With this B2B approach it will help them to acquire more clients and along with the current services I would add a couple services more i.e. Lending services, Estate & Trust Planning, Tax advice, mortgage advise, robo-realtor, Insurance Tech, Payments/Ecommerce/Billing

Adding this value added services will help Justwealth transform itself a one stop service firm for all the financial needs of a customer and converting itself to a big conglomerate such as NBFCs (Non-Banking Financial Services).

There are various technology available that can be used for the above recommendations and some are already been used in the industry. To name a few big data, AI machine learning, data analytics are some of them. Along with these, Justwealth can adopt blockchain technology into their business to implement some of the new services like Estate&Trust planning, mortgage planning and advise etc.
